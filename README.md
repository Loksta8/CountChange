# CountChange
This program will count the coins you enter and return a dollar amount for you. 
I wrote this program back in early 2010 when I was beginning my journey to teaching myself Java. 
I found it in one of my old spare hard drives and it's pretty cool. I'm sure there are much better ways to calculate this but I was super proud when I wrote this program back then. Hopefully people will enjoy it! Thank you!
